                    <h3>Site purpose</h3>
                    <p>myrecipegenius.com is a site that solves all of the worlds problems.  At least the one that plague the people that sit in front of the pantry or fridge thinking, “What am I going to make to eat?!”. Recipe Genius takes the ingredients that you input and returns recipes that you could make with the food that you have. Find a recipe that you loved? You can also save recipes to you favorites. There is also a function for those of you have that have specific function to cook for because lets face it  meals aren’t created equal. You wouldn’t take a turkey dinner on a hike, or serve energy granola for dinner.  Bottom line if you need a recipe, Recipe Genius is the place to find it.  </p>
